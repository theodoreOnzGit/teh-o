# teh-o
Transport, Eigenvalue and Hybrid Open Source  Solver (teh-o) 

## Purpose 

A Free and Open Source Monte Carlo and/or deterministic solver library 
meant for neutron transport and coupled reactor multiphysics problems 
developed in Singapore.
It takes inspiration from OpenMC's algorithms and translates lots of its 
API to the Rust programming language. However, it is meant to make 
improvements and make the coupling with thermal hydraulics solvers 
easier. This could be a direct coupling of Monte Carlo with thermal 
hydraulics, or automatic MGXS generation for multiphysics deterministic 
code.


## Nomenclature 

It is named after a beloved local beverage, teh-o (or black tea in Hokkien).
