@article{Modest2012,
abstract = {The Simplified PN-Approximation was introduced some 50 years
ago, as an intuitive three-dimensional extension to the one-dimensional
slab PN-formulation. The set of simplified-PN or
SPN equations was formulated, such that they reduced to the
standard PN-approximation for a one-dimensional slab,
resulting in 2(N+1) simultaneous first order differential equations,
subject to a modified set of Marshak boundary conditions. In this
article the method is developed further for radiative heat transfer
applications by reducing the governing equations to a small set of
simultaneous second-order, elliptic PDEs, similar to the simple
P1 equation. Each of the equations is subject to
P1-type boundary conditions. Several two-dimensional examples
are presented, including scattering, strongly inhomogeneous temperatures
and absorption coefficients.},
